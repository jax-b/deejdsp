## This is a deej project that uses custom written plugins to support displays!
This uses my modifed fork of deej. This is still in the development phase but expect to see a more finished version soon (never mind on the soon part)! Its Highly recomended that you use a microcontroller base around the Atmega32u4 (like a arduino leonardo or micro)

## TODO
~~1. Add Taskbar send File~~
2. Get a image from a session (Currently done through IconFinderAPI)
~~3. Arrange a image in the center of the screen~~
4. Convert image to .b file format see [jax-b\ssd1306FilePrep](https://github.com/jax-b/ssd1306FilePrep)
~~5. Add config file option for auto generate image (req 1-3)~~
    - ~~this will use a sha-1 hash of the process name truncated to 8 characters in order to prevent confilt with user generated images~~
    - ~~if the file does not exist on the end device it will be generated and sent~~
6. Find free images for other deej config options (master, system, mic)

You will also need a sd card adapter in order to store your images. This can be scaled from two to eight of sliders and displays. With some work it can also be scalled far beyond.
